    "URDF describes a robot as a tree of links connected by joints. \n",

    "The links represent the physical components of the robot, and the joints represent how one link moves relative to another link, effectively defining the location of the links in space.\n",

    "## The link: \n",

    "A part of the robot is moving relative to another part (e.g. each segment of a robotic arm) or A part that is not moving relative to another part, but it is convenient to have its own reference point and transform (a common example would be the location of a sensor such as a camera or lidar)\n",
